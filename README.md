# 🖼️ Image Processing Fundamentals — Assignment

## 🔍 Project Overview
This repository contains solutions for the **Image Processing Fundamentals** assignment.  
You will find step-by-step implementations (in a Jupyter Notebook) of common image processing tasks using OpenCV, Pillow, NumPy and Matplotlib — including transformations, filtering, color-space operations, histogram analysis, morphological ops, and visual effects (sketch / cartoon).

---

## 🎯 Objective
Apply basic image processing techniques to:
- Load, display, and transform images
- Perform filtering, edge detection, thresholding, and morphology
- Analyze image histograms and add/remove noise
- Create sketch / cartoon effects
- Produce clear visuals and short explanations for each step

## 📋 Tasks Covered
1. Load & display images (color & grayscale)  
2. Resize & crop; save cropped images  
3. Rotate (90°, 180°, 270°) & flip (horizontal/vertical)  
4. Color-space conversions (HSV, LAB, YCrCb) & Hue extraction  
5. Brightness & contrast adjustments  
6. Image blurring: average, Gaussian, median  
7. Edge detection: Canny, Sobel, Laplacian  
8. Thresholding: global & adaptive  
9. Morphological ops: erosion, dilation, opening, closing  
10. Image arithmetic: add, subtract, blend  
11. Masking: circular/rectangular masks & extraction  
12. Histogram analysis & histogram equalization  
13. Noise addition (Gaussian, Salt & Pepper) & removal  
14. Borders & padding (constant, reflect, replicate)  
15. Geometric transforms: affine & perspective  
16. Sketch & cartoon effects (pencil sketch, bilateral filter)

For each task you will see:
- Input image
- Processed output image
- Short 2–3 line explanation
